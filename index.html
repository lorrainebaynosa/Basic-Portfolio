                <p> As a second-generation American, I was born in Los Angeles and raised in Echo Park, California. Born
                    to Filipino-American parents, the importance of education was ingrained in my brother and me. I
                    attended high school at Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles and attended UCLA for two years.
                    In pursuit of a nursing degree, I transferred to USC to pursue by Bachelors of Science in Nursing
                    (BSN) degree. In 2006, I obtained my Masters Degree in Nursing Administration at UCLA.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> My nursing career has spanned nearly nineteen years. Within that time frame, I have held clinical,
                    administrative, and management positions in Nursing and had the opportunity to work at several
                    facilities within the California region, namely the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, UCLA
                    Santa Monica Medical Center, Saint John's Health Center, and Kaiser Permanente, Santa Clara.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Given my passion for Business, I decided to attend a UCLA Coding Bootcamp, with the hope of creating
                    applications that may target some of the efficiencies in healthcare. Hopefully, these products will
                    transform healthcare as we know it today.
